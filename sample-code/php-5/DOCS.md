## Version 2 Sample Code for PHP 5+

### Installation instructions

PHP 5+ and the cURL library (for making HTTP requests) are the only requirements for these examples.

* Copy `config-dist.php` to `config.php` and put your API Key in the variable there.

* Run the various example scripts

    `php user_agent_parse.php`

    `php user_agent_parse_batch.php`

    `php software_version_numbers.php`

    These scripts simply print various outputs to the terminal. Take these examples and integrate them with your system as you require.
